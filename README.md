# Extract-Coverletter-using-GPT3
This repository consists of a python file that extracts a cover letter by using a resume in a pdf format. To implement this model I have used GPT3's text-davinci-003 model that is optimal for text generation.

This project can be extended by using the job description pdf file to get more specific requirements on the coverletter. In future I will be working on converting this file using streamlit app.
